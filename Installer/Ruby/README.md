## Installer that will patch android to install Tada

### Requirements
* Your android need to be rooted. [iRoot](http://www.mgyun.com/m/en) may help.
* Install Ruby 1.9.3 or later. ( [Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) , [other OS](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) )
* Open terminal or command prompt to install rubyzip with the following command
```
gem install rubyzip
```

### How to install
* Make sure you backup everything before you use ( i.e. nandroid backup )
* Open terminal or command prompt to run it with the following command
```
ruby Tada.rb
```
* It will ask if you also want to see the original text. Without original text you will lose hyper link text. For example, "Continue reading" in facebook posts will not be clickable after being converted. You're advised to choose 'Y' for this matter.
* Sit back, relax and it will do the rest for you

### How to Uninstall
* Run it with the same command you run to install
* It will detect whether your device is installed Tada or not. If not, it won't let you uninstall
 
### Please, use it at your own risk
