## Tada
Tada is created to help Zawgyi users move to unicode. Plus, Unicode users will be able to see Zawgyi because it detects Zawgyi and convert it to Unicode from system level. So, everything written in Zawgyi in your phone will be converted to Unicode.


### What all these folders all about
* In a folder named "Installer", you can find an installer used to install Tada onto your rooted android device.
* In a folder named "ROM Source", you can find some class files used to embed Tada into your ROM while compiling.
* In a folder named "TadaSmaliGenerator", you can find a generator that generates a Tada.smali which is used as an asset in the installer.
